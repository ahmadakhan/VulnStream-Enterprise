## Corrected behavior

- Every completed run reconciles active inventory against the entire cached CVE corpus. The selected time window controls feed ingestion; it no longer hides older cached vulnerabilities from newly registered assets.
- Existing findings refresh their vulnerability data, enrichment, evidence and applicability while retaining their IDs, audit timeline, operator lifecycle decisions and delivery history.
- Correcting an unknown version can promote a review finding to a confirmed match. Patching, disabling or removing inventory marks a retained finding `NOT_APPLICABLE`, rather than leaving it queued indefinitely. Returning inventory to an affected version re-evaluates it without creating a duplicate finding.
- The delivery worker checks current asset/CVE applicability and operator lifecycle status before sending a queued advisory. A stale bundle fails without contacting the transport. When the delivery worker detects a stale bundle — meaning at least one finding is no longer applicable — it marks all sibling outbox jobs as `FAILED` and calls `rebuildFromCurrentInventory()` in `pipeline.ts`, which queues an immediate pipeline run so the bundle is reconstructed from current matches within the same tick cycle. If all jobs in that bundle failed this applicability check and none was accepted, the pipeline's `staleBundles` detection clears the `advisoryId` on retained findings so `reconcileFindings` re-queues them. Accepted or partially accepted bundles are never automatically resent by this recovery path. Explicit provider retries remain at least once.
- The delivery staleness signature (`revision()` / `findingRevision()`) covers only content-relevant CVE fields that surface in the delivered advisory — `cvss`, `cweMatches`, `versionRange`, `remediation`, `cisaKev.isKev` and the other fields shared with the pipeline's `matchingCveSignature`. Enrichment and metadata fields refreshed independently by feed adapters (EPSS scores, exploit status, source-feed attribution, modification timestamps, CPE weakness IDs) are excluded, so a benign enrichment refresh no longer produces a false "CVE intelligence changed" failure. The finding fingerprint likewise drops `exploitRisk` (derived from those same enrichment fields) so the ON-CONFLICT resurrection can correctly match a failed job when only scores changed.
- An explicit CPE version and its interval must both match. Unsupported vendor version ordering yields review candidates instead of treating an unreliable comparison as proof of exclusion. Duplicate CVEs within one correlation input use the latest modification date rather than arrival order.
- The daily digest queues its payload through the same `enqueue()` path, so it records `findingRevisions` and `cveRevisions` alongside `cveIds` and `includedFindingIds`. Without that evidence every daily-digest job would be rejected by the delivery worker as a legacy payload.
- The finding fingerprint covers identity and affected system only (`cveId`, asset ID, asset name). `matchedCpe` and the free-text `matchingEvidence` are excluded: the CPE is the NVD criterion in a pipeline finding but the inventory CPE in a revalidation match, and the evidence string embeds the confidence the policy happened to require. Including them made `deliverNext` report "inventory or matching evidence changed" — and fail the bundle as stale — on a benign difference in spelling or policy, which is what produced the `ADV-DAILY_20261029` failure.
- A digest bundle may include findings that are still held for review, because a daily digest summarises the last 24 hours. The delivery worker accepts a review-held finding in a digest as long as it still matches current inventory; the same finding in a non-digest bundle is still refused. Once a transport accepts a bundle, the findings it actually carried (`includedFindingIds`) move to dispatched state, so the same finding is not re-queued and re-sent every day. Findings belonging to other batches of the same advisory are not touched, and an advisory that has any accepted batch is not reported `FAILED` because of a later unrelated partial batch.
- Execution pages display the worker's persisted phases, actual durations and distinct queue counts. Queueing is not represented as transport acceptance. Reruns report current matches rather than claiming retained findings are newly discovered.

## Verification

Six database-backed lifecycle regressions failed before the fixes and passed afterward: old-cache/new-inventory matching, review promotion, patch/removal invalidation, refreshed CVE/enrichment, blocked stale delivery and enrichment-only staleness. The tests also cover stable IDs, preservation of operator decisions, safe bundle rebuilding and duplicate suppression after transport acceptance. Three additional matching regressions reproduce explicit-version/range conflicts, unsupported vendor ordering and duplicate arrival order.

The digest path adds one more regression: a finding held by the confidence policy is included in the daily digest and delivered (transport called once, status `ACCEPTED`, the finding released for dispatch), while the same held finding in a non-digest bundle is still refused without contacting the transport.

Final validation: with `TEST_DATABASE_URL` set, **509 of 511 tests passed, zero skips**, and TypeScript checking (`npm run lint`) passed. The two failures (`password-reset`, `pipeline-audit-regressions`) abort in schema migration with `42P01 relation "assets" does not exist` while building `correlation_assets_cpe`; they fail identically with these changes stashed and are unrelated to them.

A browser-queued run completed against an isolated PostgreSQL test database. It reconciled the patched fixture to `NOT_APPLICABLE`, retained four historical findings with three current matches, queued no duplicate deliveries, and displayed the three measured phases correctly. Screenshot: [pipeline-fix-verification.png](pipeline-fix-verification.png).

No live provider messages were sent. Transport tests use injected acknowledgements. Applicability is checked immediately before transport; inventory changes after that check cannot retract an already submitted notification. Historical findings and accepted advisories remain retained for review.

## Stale-bundle failure reasons

The delivery worker labels why a queued advisory was rejected so the reason is visible in the outbox and in the rebuild error:

- `current inventory no longer matches` — no current asset/CVE pair; `rebuildFromCurrentInventory()` clears the advisory binding, `reconcileFindings` retains the finding as `NOT_APPLICABLE`, and it is not re-queued.
- `current applicability or confidence policy requires review` — the finding still matches, but the workspace confidence policy now holds it as `REVIEW_REQUIRED` (for example the threshold was raised from 80% to 90% after the bundle was queued). The stale bundle fails, the sibling jobs fail with the same reason and an immediate pipeline run is queued. The run reconciles the finding to `REVIEW_REQUIRED` under the current policy; because it is neither `QUEUED_FOR_DISPATCH` nor `AUTO_DISPATCHED` it is **not** added to a new advisory and the delivery worker never calls the transport for it. Restoring a policy that admits the finding (or an operator ruling) makes the next run queue it again.
- `CVE intelligence changed`, `a CVE was withdrawn`, `a finding was resolved or dismissed`, `inventory or matching evidence changed` — the bundle is stale for that specific reason; accepted or partially accepted advisories are never resent automatically.

## Fixed (29 October 2026): strict CPE matching bypass for partial wildcard versions

**Severity: High.** Commit `401eba4` added `hasUnescapedCpeWildcard(assetParsed.version)` to the `assetVersionUnasserted` check in `matchesWatchlistItem` (`src/utils/cpeMatcher.ts`). This set `unverifiedVersion=true` for **any** partial wildcard version (e.g., `2.*`), causing `matchCPE` to bypass the version token mismatch check — so an asset CPE version `2.*` incorrectly matched a vulnerability whose CPE pins version `1.5`. The result was a false-positive `REVIEW_REQUIRED` finding. When multiple assets shared a non-intersecting wildcard version, the same CVE appeared N times on the Vulnerabilities page, producing the reported "duplicate CVEs under review."

The fix narrows `assetVersionUnasserted` to only cover truly missing (`-`) or literal `*` versions. Partial wildcards (`1.*`, `2.*`, `1.?`) now flow through `matchComponent`'s normal token comparison:

- Non-intersecting (`2.*` vs `1.5`): `matchComponent` rejects via `globIntersects` → **no finding**.
- Potentially intersecting (`1.*` vs `1.5`): `matchComponent` accepts → `contextNeedsReview` (via `hasUnescapedCpeWildcard` at line 832) holds it for review → `REVIEW_REQUIRED` (70%).
- Literal `*` or missing `-`: `unverifiedVersion` bypass applies → `REVIEW_REQUIRED` (70%).

The companion `hasUnescapedCpeWildcard` check in `contextNeedsReview` ensures overlapping wildcards are still correctly identified as review candidates. The evidence string for review findings without a version range no longer incorrectly states "(90% confidence)" — it now reads "(70% confidence)".

### Regression tests

- `non-intersecting wildcard asset version does not match a concrete vuln version` — verifies `matchCPE` and `matchesWatchlistItem` reject `2.*` vs `1.5` while accepting `1.*` vs `1.5` as `REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- `non-intersecting wildcard assets do not produce duplicate CVE findings` — verifies the pipeline produces zero findings when three assets with `2.*` face a CVE pinned to `1.5`.

All 44 audit tests and 382 unit tests pass; TypeScript typecheck is clean.
