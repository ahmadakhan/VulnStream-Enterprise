/**
 * Dead-man's switch heartbeat.
 *
 * Every other alert in `deploy/monitoring/vulnstream-alerts.yml` evaluates a
 * expression *against* VulnStream and fires when that expression is unhealthy.
 * That design has one blind spot it cannot cover: if VulnStream, the database,
 * and the monitor collector are all gone — one node, a lost cluster, a wiped
 * volume — there is nothing left to evaluate the rule, so **no alert fires**.
 * The absence of data looks identical to the absence of a problem.
 *
 * The only reliable way to detect a total outage is to invert the direction:
 * the monitored system must affirmatively say "I am alive" to a party that does
 * not live inside it, and *that* party must alert on silence. This module
 * publishes that affirmation.
 *
 * Delivery is deliberately dumb: a single HTTP POST to an operator-configured
 * URL (an uptime service such as healthchecks.io, a PagerDuty Events endpoint,
 * or any receiver that alarms on missed pings). It is fire-and-forget, bounded,
 * and failure of the ping itself never affects ingestion — a heartbeat that can
 * take down the system it monitors is worse than no heartbeat.
