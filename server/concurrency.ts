/**
 * Runs `fn` over `items` with bounded concurrency, dispatching at most one
 * new call every `intervalMs`. This preserves the exact request *rate* of a
 * strictly serial `for (...) { await sleep(interval); await fn(item) }` loop,
 * but lets up to `concurrency` requests be in flight at once so each item's
 * network latency is overlapped rather than added on top of every wait —
 * the dominant cost in a large per-CVE detail-fetch loop.
 *
 * Fails closed: once any call throws, no further work is dispatched and the
 * first error is rethrown after in-flight work settles, matching the
 * all-or-nothing semantics of the serial loop it replaces (a partially
 * fetched batch is never returned as if it were complete).
 *
 * Results are written back by index, so the returned array preserves the
 * same order as `items` regardless of completion order.
