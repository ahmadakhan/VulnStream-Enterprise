-- operational_events was created in migration 002 with only the pipeline-event
-- shape (category/code/message/run_id/context), but the correlation telemetry
-- writer (server/correlation/telemetry.ts) persists a different, per-worker
-- shape. On a fresh database every advisory ingest therefore failed with
-- "column sequence does not exist" and was dead-lettered — the correlation
-- pipeline had never worked end to end.
--
-- Both shapes are supported additively: the pipeline columns stay, and the
-- telemetry columns are added nullable so existing rows remain valid.
--
-- Durable clock. The telemetry writer supplies its own `timestamp`, but every
-- consumer of this table reads `occurred_at`:
--   * retention deletes WHERE occurred_at < cutoff (server/retention.ts)
--   * the event reader orders by id and reports occurred_at (server/events.ts)
-- A telemetry row therefore arrived with occurred_at NULL: invisible to the
-- event viewer and, critically, never matched by retention. Instead of relying
-- on the writer to always populate both clocks, occurred_at is made to default
-- from timestamp here, so no caller can create an immortal row. A BEFORE
-- trigger is used rather than a generated column because timestamp is nullable
-- (the pipeline shape does not supply it) and a generated column cannot be
-- overridden by a DEFAULT.
--
-- Timestamp agreement. The two clocks cannot silently diverge because
-- occurred_at is derived from timestamp whenever timestamp is present; a caller
-- cannot persist a durable clock that contradicts its own telemetry clock.
